# 02514 Deep Learning in Computer Vision

Set of the 3 projects carried out indicidually for the course _02514 Deep Learning in Computer Vision_ at Tehnical University of Denmark (DTU).

## Image Classification

In this project, we will recreate Jian-Yangs (from Silicon Valley on HBO) hotdog/not hotdog algorithm. The purpose of the algorithm is to classify images into two classes: hotdog or not hotdog. This algorithm classifies images into one of two categories, hence it is an instance of a Binary Classifier.
    
A dataset of images containing either hotdogs or something that is not a hotdog have been provided. The images come from the ImageNet categories: pets, furniture, people, food, frankfurter, chili-dog, hotdog. The dataset is already divided in train and test, where in total we can find around 3000 images.
